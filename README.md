## 📊 Project Summary

**Wheels of Danger** is a comprehensive data-driven research and visualization project that explores the *when, where, how, and who* behind Kenya's road traffic accidents, with a sharp lens on Nairobi.

From identifying fatal hotspots and behavioral trends to highlighting emergency response failures and citizen responsibilities, this report transforms data into **a call to action.** It is not just a study—it’s a movement to reroute the country toward safer roads.

## 🚦 The Road to Change: 10 Citizen Actions

1. **Think Before You Cross** – Use footbridges and wear reflectives at night.
2. **Ride Smart, Ride Right** – Demand helmets, vests, and licensed boda riders.
3. **Reject Drunk Driving** – Speak up, even if it's your friend.
4. **Stay Off Phones** – Distraction kills both drivers and walkers.
5. **Know the Risky Hours** – Avoid travel during 7–9AM & 4–8PM if possible.
6. **Call Out Recklessness** – Say no to speeding matatus and rogue riders.
7. **Learn First Aid** – When ambulances delay, you might be someone’s only hope.
8. **Report Dangerous Roads** – Broken signage? No lights? Speak out.
9. **Educate Your Circle** – Road safety starts at home and in our neighborhoods.
10. **Lead by Example** – Your discipline can influence others silently.

🛑 **Bottom Line: We Are the Traffic.**  
If we wait for laws alone to fix this, we’ll wait forever. Change starts with us.

## ⭐ Final Word

This isn’t just about traffic.  
It’s about **who we lose**, **why we lose them**, and **how we stop it.**  
Let’s stop making road safety a seasonal conversation.  
Let’s make it a daily decision.
